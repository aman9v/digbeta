# Influence and Leverage for active learning on regression problems.

Based on the statistical concepts of *leverage* of linear regression,
we should be able to recommend points that are most useful to get a label.
* What would be the GP version?
* How it this related to D-optimal design?
* *Leverage* additionally takes the residual error into account, and therefore
needs access to the labels to compute. However a semi-supervised approach might be feasible.
