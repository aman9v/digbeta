The problem of recommending tours to travellers is an important and broadly studied area.
Suggested solutions include various approaches of points-of-interest (POI)
recommendation and route planning.
We consider the task of recommending a sequence of POIs 
%as a tour to travellers
, that simultaneously uses information about POIs and routes.
Our approach unifies the treatment of various sources of information
by representing them as features in machine learning algorithms, enabling us to
learn from past behaviour. %without specialised treatment of spatial, temporal or social information.
Information about POIs are used to learn a POI ranking model
that accounts for the start and end points of tours.
Data about previous trajectories are used for learning transition patterns between POIs that
enable us to recommend probable routes.
In addition, a probabilistic model is proposed
%and a Structured Support Vector Machine are used
to combine the results of POI ranking as well as the POI-POI transitions.
We propose a new F$_1$ score on pairs of POIs
that capture the order of visits.
Empirical results show that our approach improves on
recent methods, and demonstrate that
combining points and routes enables better trajectory recommendations.
