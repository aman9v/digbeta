We experiment on datasets with trajectories extracted from Flickr photos~\cite{thomee2016yfcc100m} in five cities, 
namely, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Melbourne, Osaka and Toronto, with statistics shown in Table~\ref{tab:data}.
The Melbourne dataset is built using approaches proposed in earlier work~\cite{ht10, ijcai15},
and the other four datasets are provided by Lim et al.~\cite{ijcai15}.

We use leave-one-out cross validation to evaluate different trajectory recommendation algorithms,
i.e., when testing on a trajectory, all other trajectories are used for training.
We compare with a number of baseline approaches such as \textsc{Random}, 
which naively chooses POIs uniformly at random (without replacement) from the set $\mathcal{P} \setminus \{p_s, p_e \}$ to form a trajectory,
and \textsc{PoiPopularity}, which recommends trajectories based on the popularity of POIs only.
%, the 9 variants of approaches are summarised below, with an overview in Table~\ref{tab:algsummary}.
%
% baseline: Random, PersTour, PersTour-L, PoiPopularity
%{\bf Baseline approaches} including \textsc{Random} 
%It does not utilise any features related to POI or query, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:algsummary}.
%
%A naive approach would be to recommend the trajectory based on the popularity (number of distinct visitors)~\cite{ht10} of POIs only,
%that is we always suggest the top-$k$ most popular POIs for all visitors given the start and end location, 
%and its only adaptation to a particular request is to adjust $k$ to match the desired length.
%
Among the related approaches from recent literature, 
\textsc{PersTour}~\cite{ijcai15} explores POI features as well as the sub-tour elimination constraints (Section~\ref{sec:nosubtour}), 
with an additional time budget, and its variant \textsc{PersTour-L}, 
which replaces the time budget with a constraint of trajectory length (number of POIs to visit).
Variants of point- and route-ranking approaches including \textsc{PoiRank} and \textsc{Markov} (Section~\ref{sec:rankplan}),
which utilises either POI features or POI-POI transitions,
and \textsc{Rank+Markov} (Section~\ref{sec:rank+markov}) that incorporates both, %POI features and transition probabilities.
variants that employ additional sub-tour elimination constraints 
(\textsc{MarkovPath} and \textsc{Rank+MarkovPath}, Section~\ref{sec:nosubtour}) are also included.


% Parameters
\eat{
{\bf Parameters} of these algorithms.
We use a $0.5$ trade-off parameter for \textsc{PersTour} and \textsc{PersTour-L},
found to be the best weighting by \textsc{PersTour}~\cite{ijcai15}.
We set the regularisation parameter in rankSVM to  $10.0$, determined by cross-validation.
The trade-off value in \textsc{Rank+Markov} and \textsc{Rank+MarkovPath} is also $0.5$.
% and the regularisation parameter in \textsc{StructuredSVM} is $1.0$.

A commonly used metric for POI recommendation and evaluating trajectories is
the F$_1$ score on points, which is the harmonic mean between the point-wise precision and recall~\cite{ijcai15}.
%%
%%
\eat{
Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the trajectory that was visited in the real world,
and $\hat{\cal T}$ be the recommended trajectory,
$\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{T}}$ be the set of POIs visited in $\mathcal{T}$,
and $\mathcal{P}_{\hat{\mathcal{T}}}$ be the set of POIs visited in $\hat{\mathcal{T}}$,
we compute trajectory F$_1$ as the harmonic mean between the point-wise precision and recall.
%was defined as
\begin{displaymath}
F_1= \frac{2  P_{\textsc{point}}  R_{\textsc{point}}}
          {P_{\textsc{point}} + R_{\textsc{point}}}
\end{displaymath}
where
\vspace{-1.1em}
\begin{displaymath}%\eqmoveup
P_{\textsc{point}} = \frac{|\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{T}} \cap \mathcal{P}_{\hat{\mathcal{T}}}|}
                          {|\hat{\mathcal{T}}|},
R_{\textsc{point}} = \frac{|\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{T}} \cap \mathcal{P}_{\hat{\mathcal{T}}}|}
                          {|\mathcal{T}|}
\end{displaymath}
A perfect F$_1$ score (i.e., F$_1 = 1$) means the POIs in
the recommended trajectory are exactly the same POIs as those in the ground truth,
and F$_1 = 0$ means that none of the POIs in the real trajectory was recommended.
}
%%
%%
While being good at measuring whether POIs are correctly recommended, 
F$_1$ score on points ignores the visiting order between POIs.
%Two trajectories with the exactly same set of POIs can be completely different to visitors
%given different routes.
%Even with the exactly same set of places, the visiting experiences are completely different because
%of the dramatically disparate routes.
%Enlightened by this observation,
We propose a new metric $\text{pairs-F}_1$ that considers both points identity and visiting orders, 
by measuring the F$_1$ score of every pair of ordered POIs, whether they are adjacent or not,
%%that takes into account both the point identity and the visiting orders in a trajectory.
%%This is done by measuring the F$_1$ score of every pair of ordered POIs, whether they are adjacent or not,
%\vspace{-1.0em}
\begin{displaymath}
\text{pairs-F}_1 = \frac{2 P_{\textsc{pair}} R_{\textsc{pair}}}
                        {P_{\textsc{pair}} + R_{\textsc{pair}}},
\end{displaymath}
where $P_{\textsc{pair}}$ and $R_{\textsc{pair}}$ the precision and recall of POI pairs respectively.
%%
%%
\eat{
\vspace{-2.0em}
\begin{displaymath}%\eqmoveup
~~
P_{\textsc{pair}} = \frac{N_c} {|\hat{\mathcal{T}}|(|\hat{\mathcal{T}}|-1) / 2}, ~
R_{\textsc{pair}} = \frac{N_c} {|\mathcal{T}|(|\mathcal{T}|-1) / 2}
\end{displaymath}
and $N_c$ is the number of ordered POI pairs $(p_j, p_k)$ that
appear in both the ground-truth and the recommended trajectories.
%satisfies the following
%conditions\footnote{We define pairs-F$_1=0$ if $N_c$ is $0$.}:
\begin{align*}
    (p_j \prec_{\mathcal{T}} p_k ~\land~ p_j \prec_{\hat{\mathcal{T}}} p_k)  ~\lor~
    (p_j \succ_{\mathcal{T}} p_k ~\land~ p_j \succ_{\hat{\mathcal{T}}} p_k) 
\end{align*}
with $p_j \ne p_k, ~p_j, p_k \in \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{T}} \cap \mathcal{P}_{\hat{\mathcal{T}}}, ~1 \le j \ne k \le |\mathcal{T}|$.
Here $p_j \prec_{\mathcal{T}} p_k$ denotes POI $p_j$ was visited before POI $p_k$ in $\mathcal{T}$
and $p_j \succ_{\mathcal{T}} p_k$ denotes $p_j$ was visited after $p_k$ in $\mathcal{T}$.
}
%%
%%
pairs-F$_1$ takes values between 0 and 1. A perfect pairs-F$_1$ (1.0) is achieved if and only if
both the POIs and their visiting orders in the
recommended trajectory are exactly the same as those in the ground truth.
pairs-F$_1 = 0$ means none of the recommended POI pairs was actually visited in the real trajectory.
An illustration is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pairf1},
the solid grey lines represent the ground truth transitions that actually visited by travellers,
and the dashed blue lines are the recommended trajectory by one of the approaches described in Section~\ref{sec:recommendation}.
%in Table~\ref{tab:algsummary}. 
Both examples have a perfect F$_1$ score, but not a perfect pairs-F$_1$ score due to the difference in POI sequencing.

% compare both F1 and pair F1 at the same time
The performance of the baseline algorithm and the POI ranking and routing variants
on five trajectories datasets are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:f1}
and Table~\ref{tab:pairf1}, in terms of trajectory F$_1$ score and pairs-F$_1$, respectively.

% 6. xxPath vs. xx:
% MarkovPath vs Markov:
% in terms of F1, MarkovPath (Rank+MarkovPath) is always better than Markov (Rank+Markov),
% in terms of pair F1, MarkovPath (Rank+MarkovPath) yields comparable or worse performance than Markov.
% which indicates that sub-tour elimination helps POI prediction but worsen the visiting order.

We can see from Table~\ref{tab:f1} that \textsc{MarkovPath} and \textsc{Rank+MarkovPath}
outperform their corresponding variants \textsc{Markov} and \textsc{Rank+Markov} without the path constraints in terms of F1.
This demonstrates that eliminating sub-tours improves point recommendation.
This is expected, as sub-tours worsen the proportion of correctly
recommended POIs since a length constraint is used.
On the contrary, most Markov chain entries have better performance in terms of pairs-F$_1$
which indicates Markov chain approaches generally
respect the transition patterns between POIs.
% go to SSVM
%The effect of sub-tours on trajectory recommendation can be further observed through the performance of \textsc{StructuredSVM}.
%
%While utilising the same features as \textsc{Rank+Markov} and \textsc{Rank+MarkovPath},
%it is more flexible with automatic tuning of the trade-off of points and routes, resulting in
%the best performance with respect to pair-F1 in Edinburgh, Osaka and Toronto.


% go to ranking based algorithms
Algorithms based on POI rankings yield strong performance
by exploring POI and query specific features.
%
% 3. PoiRank vs. PoiPopularity
\textsc{PoiRank} improves notably upon \textsc{PoiPopularity} and \textsc{PersTour}
 by leveraging more POI features and query specific features in 3 out of 5 datasets.
%except slightly worse on Edinburgh dataset on which \textsc{PoiPopularity} is the best and
%second best performer in terms trajectory F$_1$ and pairs-F$_1$ respectively.
% go to transition based algorithms
On the other hand, Algorithm that leverage transition probabilities alone does not perform particularly well.
%
% 4. PoiRank vs. Markov:
% in terms of F1, PoiRank always performs much better, except on Osaka where both yield comparable performance
In terms of trajectory F$_1$,
\textsc{Markov} can not outperform \textsc{PoiRank} except on Osaka dataset,
on which the performance of both algorithms are comparable.
In particular, algorithms with ranking information (e.g. \textsc{Rank+Markov} and \textsc{Rank+MarkovPath}) 
always out-perform their respective variants with transition information alone (i.e. \textsc{Markov} and \textsc{MarkovPath}).

% in terms of pair F1, PoiRank is significantly better on Glasgow, Melbourne and Toronto, comparable on Edinburgh
\textsc{PoiRank} performs significantly better than \textsc{Markov} on three datasets, namely,
Glasgow, Melbourne and Toronto.
%
% at the first sight, it seems strange because Markov modelled the transitions and pair F1 measures the visiting order
% but actually pair F1 is affected heavily by the number of correctly predicted POIs, once the POIs are correctly predicted, it will yield
% better pair F1, this is consistent with the observation that, on Osaka dataset, Markov and PoiRank yield comparable F1,
% but Markov outperforms PoiRank significantly in terms of pair F1.
This result may seem strange at first sight because \textsc{Markov} modelled the transition patterns and it could leverage
this advantage to accomplish better performance in terms of pairs-F$_1$ given the fact that this metric is measuring the quality
of visiting order.
However, pairs-F$_1$ is actually affected heavily by the proportion of correctly recommended POIs in trajectory,
once the POIs are correctly predicted, a better pairs-F$_1$ would be achieved,
this supposition can be confirmed by the observation that, on Osaka dataset, \textsc{Markov} and \textsc{PoiRank} achieved
comparable performance in terms of trajectory F$_1$, which means the proportion of correctly recommended POIs is comparable,
but \textsc{Markov} outperforms \textsc{PoiRank} significantly in terms of pairs-F$_1$,
which suggest the transition information is helpful in some situations.

% 5. PoiRank vs. Markov vs. Rank+Markov
% in terms of both F1 and pair F1,
% when the advantage of PoiRank over Markov is large, Rank+Markov always brings improvements on Markov, but can't compete with PoiRank
% as the advantage gap of PoiRank over Markov shrinks, performance of Rank+Markov becomes closer to PoiRank,
% when the Markov is comparable or better than PoiRank, Rank+Markov outperforms both (Osaka)
% which is consistent with the assumption that transition helps when ranking didn't performs very well
Transition information helps point ranking when their performances are comparable.
When the advantage gap of \textsc{PoiRank} over \textsc{Markov} is large,
i.e. Edinburgh, Glasgow, Melbourne and Toronto in Table~\ref{tab:f1} and Glasgow, Toronto in Table~\ref{tab:pairf1},
transition information does not help \textsc{Rank+Markov}, which explores both POI ranking and transitions,
can not compete with \textsc{PoiRank} in both metrics, but nevertheless brings improvements to \textsc{Markov}.
However, as the performance of \textsc{Markov} approaches or surpasses that of \textsc{PoiRank},
i.e., Osaka in Table~\ref{tab:f1} and Edinburgh, Melbourne, Osaka in Table~\ref{tab:pairf1},
\textsc{Rank+Markov} outperforms both of them, this observation indicates that transition information can be very helpful when
ranking does not performs well enough.


% Baseline stuff, move to the end
% always better than Random, except PersTour on Melbourne which we'll illustrate later
\textsc{PersTour}~\cite{ijcai15} always performs better than its variant \textsc{PersTour-L},
especially on Glasgow and Toronto datasets.
This indicate the time budget constraint is more helpful than length constraint for recommending trajectories.
%The exception on Melbourne dataset is explained next.
%It is obvious that algorithms captured a certain type of information as shown in Table~\ref{tab:algsummary}
%outperforms the \textsc{Random} baseline in terms of both performance metrics on all five datasets,
%except the performance of \textsc{PersTour}\cite{ijcai15} on Melbourne dataset which will be interpreted later.

% 2. PersTour vs. PersTour-L
% 8. PersTour on Melbourne:
% we observed that PersTour was outperformed by Random on Melbourne dataset in terms of both F1 and pair F1.
% it turns out on Melbourne dataset, the many of the ILPs which PersTour solve to get the recommendation result are very hard ILP instances
% in the leave-one-out evaluation, although we utilise a large scale computing cluster with modern hardware,
% there are 12\% of evaluations are failed due to ILP solver can't find a feasible solution in a $2$ hours
% furthermore, a lot recommendations are suboptimal solutions of the ILP due to the $2$ timeout settings.
% which leads to PersTour, which is always a strong performer on other datasets, performs inconsistently on Melbourne dataset.
Lastly, we observed that \textsc{PersTour} is surprisingly outperformed by \textsc{Random} baseline
on Melbourne dataset in terms of both metrics.
It turns out that, on this very dataset, many of the integer linear programming (ILP) problems
which \textsc{PersTour} need to solve to get the recommendations are difficult ILP instances.
In the leave-one-out evaluation, although we utilised a large scale computing cluster with modern hardware,
$12\%$ of evaluations failed due to the ILP solver could not find a feasible solution in $2$ hours.
Furthermore, a lot of recommendations are produced from suboptimal solutions of the corresponding ILPs due to
the $2$ hours timeout setting, these factors lead to the inconsistent performance of \textsc{PerTour} on Melbourne dataset.


\subsection{Example}
\label{sec:example}
\secmoveup



Figure~\ref{fig:exampleresult} illustrates a test case in Edinburgh dataset.
The ground truth is a trajectory of length $4$ that starts at a POI of category \textit{Structures},
visits two intermediate POIs of category \textit{Structures} and \textit{Cultural} and
terminates on a POI of category \textit{Structures}.
The trajectory recommended by \textsc{PersTour} is a tour with $11$ POIs, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exampleresult}(a),
with none of the desired intermediate POIs visited.
\textsc{PoiRank} (Figure~\ref{fig:exampleresult}(b)) recommended a tour with correct POIs,
%using POI specific features (illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:distro}) as well as query specific features,
but with completely different routes.
On the other hand, \textsc{Markov} (Figure~\ref{fig:exampleresult}(c)) missed one POI but the recommended route for one of the intermediate is consistent with the ground truth.
The best recommendation%, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exampleresult}(d), 
(Figure~\ref{fig:exampleresult}(d)) 
with exactly the same points and routes as the ground truth,
which in this case is achieved by \textsc{Rank+MarkovPath}.
