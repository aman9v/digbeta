\begin{abstract}
Content recommendation systems have seen considerable success, but have largely focussed on the case of static, unstructured content.
In many recommendation scenarios, we would like to predict content that has some sequential structure,
such as when recommending a playlist of songs, or a trajectory of points-of-interest in a city.
In this paper, we present an approach to such sequential recommendation problems based on techniques from structured prediction.
While the problem can be posed as a vanilla application of such models,
we propose two important corrections that are necessary to ensure quality recommendations.
First, we modify the training objective to take into account the existence of multiple ground truths.
Second, we modify the training and inference procedures to avoid predicting loops in the sequence via an extension of the classic Viterbi algorithm.
Experiments on two real-world trajectory recommendation datasets shows the benefits of our approach over existing, non-structured recommendation approaches.
