\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

structured prediction problems;
recsys problems and methods. 
gap: 
people need recommendation for sequences and sets (e.g. \cite{chen2012playlist}, google tour)

what we did:
define sequence recommendation problems in ML; 
novel solutions in the following aspects:
1. use structured prediction (ssvm) for recsys
2. making the recsys ranking objective work for ssvm 
3. no loops/repetitions in the recommended sequence
4. learning and inference 


Bullet list of contributions
\begin{itemize}
  \item structured recommendation 
  \item two uses of list Viterbi
  \item apply to trajectory recommendation, better than CIKM2016
  \item framework to understand related work
\end{itemize}
